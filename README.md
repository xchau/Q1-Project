# What's the name of your project?

This web app is named Miser because...


# What problem does it solve? Who has this problem? How does your project solve this problem?

My primary user (PU) is a person who is in an unfamiliar setting, on a business trip or otherwise. This PU wants to explore their surrounding area but he/she is limited by a budget or he/she just likes saving money. Miser provides local deals on dining, entertainment and retail-services in two simple layouts: map & info card. The idea is that they can quickly pull up this web app, see what they need with minimal interaction with the site, buy the deal from the vendor and be on their way.

# What web APIs did it use?
1. Sqoot: an API that that stores information on 250,000 different merchants. In particular I used Sqoot to get "deals" and "coupon" information about local merchants via an AJAX call that queried user location, a search radius, results per page and a potential user keyword query.
